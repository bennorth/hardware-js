// I have sitting on my desk ("instance"?)

// Optionally look up "specifier" in a map maintained by the manager?  So
// users can do something like requestDevice("Logitech Attack 3")?  Some
// way to dump all the device-SKUs the manager knows about.  Could
// expose this to end-user either through the app UI or in Python-land.

// For a device connected over serial, we don't care so much who made
// the USB serial adapter; we care about what's the other end of the
// serial link.  How are we going to say that?  For many (all?) of these
// situations, might be OK to just leave that up to the user, to choose
// the right serial port from the list which pops up.
